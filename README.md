# Github User Finder

This is a simple app made with Next.js and Chakra UI that allows you to search for a github user and see their profile information.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Global State Management

This application uses the Context API and useReducer for global state management. This allows us to share state between components without having to pass props down the component tree.

To get started with this application, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jashezan/github-user-finder.git
```

```bash
cd github-user-finder
```

Download Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Using the Application

To use the application, simply enter a GitHub username in the search bar and press enter. The application will return the user's profile information, including their name, avatar, and bio.

You can also click on the user's avatar to view their repositories.
